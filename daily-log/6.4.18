I got the model up and training on some sample data, and reconstruction loss curves as well as kl-divergence plots up. A few tweaks were made in the image processing script. Met with Mike and Leo, we talked about doing some extensive analysis on 8 frame channels and comparing those with diff_map configurations, then also inserting a one_hot_encoded version of the stimulus in the first afffine layer. 

One last thing to be dealt with is loading the data onto memory will likely get pretty time intensive. So we can load it into a SQL or noSQL database, in queriable format. Leo also suggests https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html

Cloned a disentangled VAE implementation from pyTorch in Github. It didn't work out of the box, so there were a few things I had to do there. Downloaded the entire chairs dataset (used in the deepMind paper) which was probably a mistake, just to see if I can replicate the results.

Spent most of the day getting set up on the server and getting access to data from Leo. Also, knowning how to run processes on the gpus 1 and 2.

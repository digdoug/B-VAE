Spent most of the day getting the tensors to be the right size. This seems like it was trivial, but as you'll see in the 6.8.18 file there were some strange dimensional issues within the network in the decode layer. So that's something I'm going to be debugging. As of now, it seems like part of it is the reparametrize function and model may require that images be divisible by 4. So I'm figuring that out.

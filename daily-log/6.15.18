I was able to get the compression and shape down into a correct format, which I wasn't able to do before. The problem I've been trying to debug now though is that it seems apparent the model isn't learning properly. I've narrowed this down to the possibility of 1 of 3 things: 1) hyperparameters (learning rate, beta, z), 2) data input (either incorrectly formatted or something else), 3) model is incorrectly doing the reparametrization trick.
